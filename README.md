# omfj.no - My personal website

My personal website. It uses NextJS with ChakraUI as component library, and Sanity for CMS. It is also hosted on Vercel.

This is something I do for fun, and to have something to play around with. Bugs are expected. Feel free to contribute if you find any bugs.

## Developing

Download all dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

By default the website is hosted on <a href="http://localhost:300">localhost:3000</a>.

```bash
yarn dev
```
