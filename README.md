# omfj.no

My personal website. It uses [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) with [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and [Sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity) for CMS. The website is on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

This is something I do for fun, and to have something to play around with. Bugs are expected. Feel free to contribute if you find any bugs.

## For developing

Clone the repository, and enter it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:omfj/omfj.no
cd omfj.no
```

Download all dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Start the server.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now you're good to go. Open the repo in your favorite code editor, for example VSCode ;)

By default the website is served on [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

## Other

The dataset is private for now. I have plans to make a boilerplate test dataset for testing. (Coming soon).

Meanwhile you can look?

I also have plans to make a backend with [Rocket.rs](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/), coming some time.
