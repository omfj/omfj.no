My name is Ole Magnus. Currently I am studying Computer Technology at
the University of Bergen. I am interested in web development, and I
have a passion for learning new things.

I am also a member of echo Webkom at the University of Bergen. Here I
help develop and maintain the website of echo.

When I am not at the computer I enjoy playing video games. I also do
Tennis during the summer and downhill skiing during the winter.
