For the mandatory assignment in INF142 (Computer Networks) we had to create a game called Team Local Tactics. The task was to make a client, server and database. The client should connect to the server and the server should wait for two clients, before it starts a game. Then when the game is over, the server could then upload the match to the database.

The purpose of this assignment was to learn about socket programming in Python, and how the network of networks talk to each other. I also took the time to learn a little about docker, so you could just spin up a docker instance instead of starting the scripts in the correct order and so on.

I also messed around with typed python, and I might actually start using typed python for lager projects. This is because it helps with the intellisense, and actaully saved me from a couple of potential bugs.
