This me trying to cli-ify the website I use for washing my clothes at my student housing.

It started with "Miele CLI", which was written in both Bash and Python. So it was small scripts.

Then when the student housing changed to AppWash, I had to make a new script. The MVP was written in Python, but I am now working on a Rust version.

So far the rust version supports these features:

- Check balance
- See purchase history
- See machine availability at your location
- Reserve and stop a machine

And some a few other minor features

Currently working on a 2.0, since I have learned a lot of Rust since when I first published this code.
