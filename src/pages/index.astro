        My name is Ole Magnus. Currently I am studying Computer Technology at

        I am also a member of <a href="https://github.com/echo-webkom"
          >echo Webkom</a

        When I am not at the computer I enjoy playing video games. I also do
        Tennis during the summer and downhill skiing during the winter.
