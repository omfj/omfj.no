I primarily use two computers, a MacBook Pro 14" with the M1 Pro and a ThinkPad Yoga that I bought used.

The Mac is for most things, since it is the more powerful of the two. I love the Apple silicon. It is a beast, both in performance and being super quiet. Also it doesn't burn my palms.

I also love the ThinkPad. I bought i second-hand, so I could have a computer do play with, and not be scared to lose any important document or files. It is running vanilla Arch, which is in my opinion the best Linux distro. I try to keep it pretty minimalist, so I use bspwm as window manager. If it wasn't for my university not properly supporting Linux computers (stuff like software support), I probably wouldn't have bought the Mac, and would use a more powerful laptop as my Linux computer.
