echo Webkom is a subgroup of the student association, echo. Members of Webkom helps with maintaining and developing the website [echo.uib.no](https://echo.uib.no/).

It is here I have learned most of what I know of JavaScript and web development. This is also the reason why I am using NextJS for my personal website.

Volunteering for Webkom is probably on the top 3 smartest decisions I have ever made. Not only am I learning a lot, but it has also given me a head start into what I will be doing for the rest of my life after university.

I also get to meet smarter people with the same interests as me.
