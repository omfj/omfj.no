A personal website is something that I have been working on for a long time. It started around 2017, when I first learned how to write HTML and CSS. Of course I was ambitious, and I wanted my website to do more than just displaying a static webpage. It was then asked my first [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47828326/password-protected-alert) (and last), in hopes of learning a bit of JavaScript. Since I was still pretty new to all of this, I did not quite understand what I was supposed to do, and ultimately gave up for a few months.

A year later I started learning HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JS and all that at my high school, and finally understood how websites are actually built. I once again started my website adventure and built a simple personal website, with a bit of JS. I also built a browser game for kids called [kurvmatte](https://kurvmatte.omfj.no).

And then a again it sort of died down until I started at university. Here my passion for coding once again exploded. I joined a subgroup at my uni department. Here I learnt about NextJS and Chakra UI, and I really enjoyed it. So I rewrote my website, once again. Actually two times. The first time I rewrote it in PHP, because I was really into minimalism, but that only lasted for a month.

Now my website uses NextJS, with Tailwind CSS. I have also added Sanity for CMS. I don't really have any use for, but it is fun to learn something new.
