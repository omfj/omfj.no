This was one of the first programming projects. It first started in 2017, when me and some friends were attending "LÃ¦r kidsa koding". Since me and my friends had done most of the recommended projects, we decided to do something ourselves. We decided on a twitter bot that uses the [yr.no](https://www.yr.no/) API, and tweets the weather. We did not know how make the script run on a server, so it mostly ran on my PC when I was at school. After a few days this got annoying. And the project got abandoned.

Five years later. I have just finished my first semester of university. While bored at Christmas break, I manage to recover the password for the twitter bot's twitter account. Because of this, I decide to resurrect the project. After a couple of days I am happy with the project and deploy it to my VPS. There I let it run for a few months before I again abandon the project. There was no more challenge in the project, so decided to stop working on it.
